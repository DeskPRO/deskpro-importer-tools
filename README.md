# Importing Data into DeskPRO

We know how important *your* data is; data portability is part of our company's core values. We are, for example, one of the few providers that will provide SaaS customers with a full export of all their data.

The DeskPRO team has put a lot of effort into helping you migrate your data into DeskPRO. You have a number of options on how to proceed.

### 1. I just want to import users and organizations.

DeskPRO includes a tool to upload a CSV of your user data directly from within the admin interface. This works on both On-Premise and Cloud deployments of DeskPRO.

### 2. I'm currently using Kayako, Zendesk, OsTicket, Spiceworks.

We currently provide importers for the following products. Please follow the instructions for the product you wish to import your data from.

### 3. I'm using a different product.

The DeskPRO importer is a platform that helps simplify writing your own importer. The following [Custom Importer Instructions](https://github.com/DeskPRO/deskpro-importer-tools/blob/master/custom/README.md) will guide you to building your own tool.

Alternatively, The DeskPRO consultancy team can write an import for you. These projects typically range from $2,000 to $20,000 in cost. Please contact sales@deskpro.com for more information.
